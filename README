Please see the "bin" directory for complete examples and all
non-flash source code and supporting files for using Agile Uploader.

You do not need to use any of these files if you wish to build
your own JavaScript that uses Flash's ExternalInterface to work
with the methods within the compiled SWF. You could then use
the agile-uploader-3.0.js file as a reference. Note that this
file uses jQuery, but you need not use jQuery if so desired.
